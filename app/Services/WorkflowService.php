/**
 * WorkflowService
 * ----------------
 * Orchestrates the full document lifecycle state machine described in
 * Section 5:
 *
 *   processing -> classified_validated -> approved   (or auto_approved)
 *                                       -> rejected
 *
 * ALL-ELIGIBLE-APPROVERS, UNANIMOUS APPROVAL MODEL: every configured stage
 * for a document's category is routed the moment the document is uploaded
 * (see routeToWorkflow()) — not one at a time. Each stage is routed to
 * EVERY eligible approver simultaneously (see assignStage()), one
 * DocumentAssignment row each, all sharing the same stage_id. A stage only
 * completes once every one of those rows is non-pending (see
 * completeStage()); a single rejection from ANY of them immediately kills
 * the whole document, same as before. There is no more load-balanced
 * "pick one" step for normal routing — is_busy no longer gates assignment
 * at all, since "assign everyone" and "skip whoever's busy" are
 * contradictory goals. The old one-winner ranking (rankApprovers()) still
 * exists and is still used, but only by findReplacementApprover() for the
 * deactivation-handoff case, which is a genuinely different operation:
 * replacing one lost seat, not routing a stage.
 *
 * Because every stage is assigned up front, a document can have more than
 * one stage pending at once (e.g. Stage 2 assigned to a specialist while
 * Stage 1 is still awaiting a different approver's decision). Stages
 * resolve independently of each other and of sequence order; the document
 * only finalizes once every stage's every seat has been resolved (see
 * completeStage()).
 *
 * ELIGIBILITY: an approver is eligible for a stage if (a) their
 * assigned_category matches the document, and (b) either they have no
 * specific stage restrictions at all (eligible for every stage in their
 * category by default) or this stage is explicitly among their assigned
 * stages (User::workflowStages()). Every eligible approver gets a seat —
 * there is no ranking/selection among them for normal routing.
 *
 * Each assignment's SLA window is 25% of the minutes remaining until the
 * document's own absolute due_date, computed at minute granularity so it
 * scales smoothly rather than in coarse hour jumps. Due dates at or under
 * 1 hour away skip the percentage and get a flat 15-minute window instead.
 * Either way, the window never extends past the due_date itself. Every
 * seat on a stage shares the identical window (computed once per stage,
 * not once per approver), and each seat escalates/auto-approves
 * completely independently of its siblings — an Admin override or
 * auto-approval on one seat fills only that seat, not the whole stage.
