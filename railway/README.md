# Deploying to Railway

This app needs **four Railway services** pointed at the same GitHub repo (`doctrack_hosting`), each with a different **Custom Start Command**, plus a MySQL database. Railway's own build detection (Railpack) already handles the web service correctly — the other three just override the start command on an otherwise-identical build.

| Service | Custom Start Command | Why it's separate |
|---|---|---|
| **web** (existing) | *(leave as Railway auto-detected — do not override)* | Serves the actual app over HTTP |
| **queue-worker** | `sh railway/start-queue-worker.sh` | Sends queued mail and processes delayed SLA-escalation jobs — see [`start-queue-worker.sh`](start-queue-worker.sh) |
| **reverb** | `sh railway/start-reverb.sh` | WebSocket server — every dashboard's real-time push depends on this running | 
| **scheduler** | `sh railway/start-scheduler.sh` | Runs the 5-minute SLA sweeps and the daily backup | 

To create each: **Railway dashboard → New → GitHub Repo → pick `doctrack_hosting` again** (same repo, new service) → **Settings → Deploy → Custom Start Command** → paste the command from the table above. Each one rebuilds from the same source but runs a different process at boot.

## Environment variables

Set these on **every** service (Railway lets you share a variable group across services — do that rather than pasting them four times):

```
APP_NAME=DocTrack
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Manila
APP_URL=https://<your-web-service's-public-domain>.up.railway.app
APP_KEY=                         # generate below, do not leave blank

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}          # or whatever Railway names your MySQL plugin's variables
DB_PORT=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PORT}}
DB_DATABASE=${{MySQL.MYSQL_DATABASE}}
DB_USERNAME=${{MySQL.MYSQL_USER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}

SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true       # served over https:// on Railway — keep this true, unlike .env.example's local-dev default
CACHE_STORE=database
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb

REVERB_APP_ID=                   # any number, e.g. 100001 — just needs to match across services
REVERB_APP_KEY=                  # random string — generate once, reuse everywhere
REVERB_APP_SECRET=               # random string — generate once, reuse everywhere
REVERB_HOST=<your-reverb-service's-public-domain>.up.railway.app
REVERB_PORT=443
REVERB_SCHEME=https

VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY="${REVERB_APP_KEY}"
VITE_REVERB_HOST="${REVERB_HOST}"
VITE_REVERB_PORT="${REVERB_PORT}"
VITE_REVERB_SCHEME="${REVERB_SCHEME}"

# --- Email (see main README.md §2.6) ---
# Without this, emails (SLA breach alerts, decision notices, dispute
# notices, account verification, password reset) silently write to a log
# file instead of actually being sent — fine for testing, not for a real
# public deployment.
#
# Uses Brevo's HTTP API, not SMTP — Railway blocks outbound SMTP
# entirely regardless of provider or port (confirmed: both
# smtp.gmail.com:587 and smtp-relay.brevo.com:587 time out identically
# from a Railway service; an HTTP API call on port 443 does not). See
# the Mail::extend('brevo', ...) registration in
# AppServiceProvider::boot() and the 'brevo' entry in config/mail.php —
# this is what lets MAIL_MAILER=brevo below resolve to anything.
#
# Brevo (not Resend) because it only needs the individual sender address
# verified (a one-click email confirmation), not a DNS-verified domain —
# useful when sending from a real personal address with no domain of
# its own:
#   1. Sign up at brevo.com, then Settings → SMTP & API → API Keys tab →
#      Generate a new API key. That's BREVO_API_KEY below.
#   2. Verify a sender (Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs → Senders → Add
#      a Sender) — confirms you can send FROM that address (e.g.
#      MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS below); you don't need to own a domain.
MAIL_MAILER=brevo
BREVO_API_KEY=your-brevo-api-key        # starts with xkeysib-, from the API Keys tab
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@yourdomain.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"

# --- File storage (Cloudflare R2) ---
# Local disk (the default, FILESYSTEM_DISK=local) does NOT survive a
# redeploy on Railway — every service's filesystem is ephemeral, so
# uploaded documents and trained ML model files would silently disappear
# on the next push. R2 is S3-API-compatible (league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3 is
# already in composer.json), so switching is just these env vars — no code
# changes anywhere, since the app only ever reads/writes via
# Storage::disk(...), never a raw file path.
#
# Get these from the Cloudflare dashboard: R2 → create a bucket → Manage
# API Tokens → Create API Token (Object Read & Write, scoped to that
# bucket) for the key/secret; the bucket's own page shows its S3 endpoint.
FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-r2-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-r2-secret-access-key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=auto
AWS_BUCKET=doctrack-documents
AWS_ENDPOINT=https://<your-cloudflare-account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT=true

BACKUP_KEEP=14

# --- Error monitoring (Sentry) ---
# Without this, the only trace of a production error is storage/logs/
# laravel.log on whichever ephemeral Railway container happens to still be
# running when you go looking — easy to lose entirely on the next redeploy.
# Get a DSN from sentry.io (free tier is enough at this scale) → create a
# Laravel project → Settings → Client Keys (DSN). Set on the web service at
# minimum; the other three (queue-worker/reverb/scheduler) benefit from it
# too if you want errors from those surfaced as well.
SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=https://your-key@your-org.ingest.sentry.io/your-project-id
```

**Four things that trip people up here:**

1. **`REVERB_HOST` must be the Reverb service's own public domain, not the web service's.** Give the `reverb` service a public domain first (Railway → that service → Settings → Networking → Generate Domain), copy it, *then* set `REVERB_HOST` to it everywhere.
2. **The `VITE_REVERB_*` variables get baked into the JS bundle at build time**, not read at runtime — this app already avoids the worst version of this problem (`resources/js/echo.js` uses `window.location.hostname` for the WebSocket host dynamically instead of trusting the build-time value), but `VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY`/`PORT`/`SCHEME` still need to be correct *before* the web service's build runs. If you set or change any `REVERB_*` variable, trigger a fresh deploy of the **web** service afterward — a variable change alone doesn't rebuild already-compiled assets.
3. **`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are secrets — never commit them.** They only ever go into Railway's environment variables (ideally the shared variable group, same as everything else here), never into `.env.example` or any file in the repo. If you ever paste a real key into a file by mistake, treat it as compromised and regenerate it from the Cloudflare dashboard rather than just deleting the line.
4. **`SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN` is safe to leave blank** if you're not ready to set up Sentry yet — the SDK silently no-ops with no DSN configured (see `config/sentry.php`), it won't error or block anything. Same "never commit a real secret" caution as the AWS keys above still applies once you do set it, even though a DSN is less sensitive than an access key (it can only submit events, not read your account).

## Generating `APP_KEY`

Run this once, locally, and paste the output into every service's `APP_KEY` variable (all four services must share the exact same key — it's what encrypts sessions and cookies):

```bash
php artisan key:generate --show
```

## Running migrations

Railway doesn't auto-run migrations on deploy. After the **web** service deploys successfully, open its **Shell** tab (or use `railway run` from the Railway CLI if you have it installed locally) and run:

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
```

`--force` is required because `APP_ENV=production` otherwise refuses to run migrations without it. Re-run this any time you deploy new migrations.

## Seeding accounts and training the classifier

Migrating alone gets you empty tables — two more one-time steps, same shell:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --force     # creates admin/originator/approver demo accounts + workflow stages
```
See main `README.md` → "Demo accounts" for the logins this creates. **Change these
passwords** before treating this as a real public deployment, not just a demo.

Then **train the ML classifier** — without a trained model, `ClassificationService::classify()`
returns `Unclassified` for every upload, which fails validation, so nothing ever routes to
an approver (silently stuck, not an error). This step needs the web UI, not the shell: log
in as `admin` → **ML Training** → for each category, select that category's sample folder
from `database/ml_training_samples/` and click its own "Add" button, then **Train Model**
once all three show enough staged. See main `README.md` §1 step 11 and §5 for details.

## Verifying PHP extensions actually installed

`composer.json` declares `ext-pcntl`, `ext-zip`, and `ext-fileinfo` as hard requirements —
Railway's Railpack build reads these from `composer.json` and should install them
automatically, but it's worth a one-time check in the **web** service's build logs (or its
Shell: `php -m | grep -E "pcntl|zip|fileinfo"`) after the first deploy. Missing `ext-zip`
specifically causes every `.docx` upload to silently skip real text extraction and fall
through to OCR instead; missing `ext-fileinfo` can cause legitimate PDF/TXT uploads to fail
the `ReliableMimeType` validation check while image uploads (png/jpg) still tend to pass,
since their signatures are recognized by more fallback paths — if uploads work for one file
type but not others, check this first.

## Order of operations for first deploy

1. Add a MySQL database to the Railway project (Railway → New → Database → MySQL).
2. Create the `web` service (already done) — confirm it builds successfully now that `composer.json`/`composer.lock` are fixed, and check its build log for `ext-pcntl`/`ext-zip`/`ext-fileinfo` actually being installed (see above).
3. Generate `APP_KEY` locally, set all the env vars above on `web`, including real SMTP credentials for `MAIL_*`.
4. Give `web` a public domain, set `APP_URL` to it.
5. Run `php artisan migrate --force` via the web service's shell.
6. Run `php artisan db:seed --force` via the same shell, then log in as `admin` and train the ML classifier (see "Seeding accounts and training the classifier" above) — skip either step and the app looks deployed but silently can't classify/route any document.
7. Create the `reverb` service, give **it** a public domain, set `REVERB_HOST` to that domain everywhere, redeploy `web` so the build picks up the correct `VITE_REVERB_*` values.
8. Create `queue-worker` and `scheduler` services with the env vars shared from the same group.
9. Log in as the seeded admin (see main `README.md` → "Demo accounts") and confirm a document upload shows up live without a manual refresh — that confirms Reverb is actually wired correctly end to end. Then upload one file of each type (.pdf, .docx, .txt, .png) as an originator and confirm every one of them gets classified rather than just the image — that confirms the extension fix above actually took effect.
